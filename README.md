<h1>Use Linux commands to manage file permissions</h1>



<h2>Scenario</h2>
You are a security professional at a large organization. You mainly work with their research team. Part of your job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

Your task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. You’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, you’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access.

Note: This scenario involves investigating and updating the same file permissions as the ones in the 
Manage authorization
 lab.  You can revisit the lab to get screenshots to include in your portfolio document. If you choose, it's also possible to complete this activity without revisiting the lab by typing your commands in the template.
